**For now, Lei is in alpha and should be considered a work in progress. I don't expect payment until it is officially released and actually useful. :) This section is here to establish expectations for the future.**

Yes, Lei is open-source, which means you can download it without paying a cent.

Yes, you should still pay.

### What to pay

Lei uses an honor system for payment. Here are the suggested tiers for one-time payments for usage of the software.

* $100 standard
* $50 educator
* $10 student
* $250 enterprise

TODO describe each tier in more detail

A Patreon or OpenCollective account for monthly payments is also on the horizon.

### Why you should pay

*Every Layout* itself has a pretty good (and wonderfully snarky) [primer](https://every-layout.dev/blog/you-pay/) on the value of labor with respect to honor-based payment systems. *Every Layout* is an online book behind a paywall, not an open-source library you can call from your own code. Its value is of a different kind. But a key similarity is in how they are produced: with a lot of time and effort. The authors' care and attention to detail are what give them their value.

This relates fundamentally to Rich Hickey's advocacy of [hammock-driven development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc): thinking through a problem for a long time instead of recklessly diving head-first into a potentially bad solution. That hammock time may not be "productive" in the vulgar, capitalistic sense of having produced something tangible, but ultimately it is a crucial part of what has made Clojure itself effective and *valuable.*

In other words, **value** is linked inextricably to **time**.

It is why Cognitect and Nubank have come out strongly in favor of [supporting open-source developers](https://cognitect.com/blog/2020/12/15/sponsoring-open-source-developers) by **paying them actual money**. They offer a poignant analysis of the economic *status quo*:

> The reality is: most companies are taking economic advantage of the generous spirit of open source developers. That needs to stop. The value of programs, and thus of programming and people who pursue it as a profession, is eroding. Little of the vast wealth derived from open source flows intentionally and systematically to its creators. This is neither fair nor sustainable.

(They unfortunately do not name capitalism itself as the problem, but oh well. You can't win 'em all.)

The bottom line is: **if you find this valuable, please pay for it.**
